Install rust onto your computer by visiting the rust [website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Once installed:
    1. navigate into the rust folder
    2. run 'cargo test' in the terminal
    3. watch the code run through the test cases

Add some more test cases and take a look at the war code in 'rust/src/main.rs'
