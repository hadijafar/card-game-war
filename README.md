# Card Game War Description

This project takes 52 numbers and plays out the [card game war](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-War-(Card-Game)). Once the card game is completed, the code returns the winners deck to show how the game played out. 

# Purpose

I wanted to gradually explore new languages and by recreating the card game war, I can learn about a new language in a fun and rewarding way.

# Installation

Please look within each language folder to find out how to install the language and run the code.
